Software Development with UML and Java 1

The main purpose of the course is to provide students with the qualifications needed to understand the core object-oriented concepts and to implement smaller programs in Java from UML class diagrams.

Throughout the semester many exercises were made to introduce me to Object-Oriented Programming.
