## **Software Development with UML and Java 1 - Class exercises, homework, etc.**

SDJ1 is a course to teach fundamental programming concepts to students with any kind of background.  
This repository is very unorganised, but it is also just a kind of personal memory thing.  

*ECTS: 10*  

### What I've learnt:  
  • Classes, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism  
  • Loops  
  • Data Structures  
  • UML diagrams, Astah  
  • GUI with JavaFX  

### Personal review:
Great course for teaching the fundamentals of OOP, amazing teacher (thank you Allan).

  ### Main purpose
  The main purpose of the course is to provide students with the qualifications needed to understand the core object-oriented concepts and to implement smaller programs in Java from UML class diagrams.

  ### Knowledge
  The student should be able to:    
    • Identify the Java lexical structures: keywords, separators, operators, identifiers, literals and comments.  
    • Explain details of UML class diagrams.  
    • Identify selection and loop structures in UML activity diagrams.  

  ### Skills
  The student should be able to:  
    • Construct Java programs with proper choice of selection and loop structures.  
    • Create and use objects in Java.   
    • Implement classes in Java using the object oriented concepts: encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.   
    • Implement one-to-one relations and differentiate between association, aggregation and composition.  
    • Implement one-to-many relations using array structures and a simple collection class.  
    • Implement exception handling for different types of exceptions.  
    • Implement persistence in text and binary files.  
    • Construct simple event-based GUI applications.  
    • Construct Java source code documentations.  
    • Interpret UML class diagrams, and construct corresponding Java code.  

  ### Competences
  The student should be able to:  
    • Exemplify and discuss basic object-oriented concepts, including encapsulation, relationships, inheritance and polymorphism.  
    • Implement small scale systems from UML class diagrams.
